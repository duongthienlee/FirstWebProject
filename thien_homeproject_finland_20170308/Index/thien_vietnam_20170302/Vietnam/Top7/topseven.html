                        Dalat which is also my hometown, I have lived in there for 20 years before coming to Finland to study.
                        Da Lat is the capital city of Lam Dong province, Vietnam, it is called the city of flowers and honeymooners
                        with the architecture of French. For example: Dalat Cathedral which has a wonderful architectural style and
                        beautiful view.

                        For the last century, Hanoi has the Indochina and Vietnam Wars to emerge
                        as the booming capital city of a reunified Vietnam. At the heart of Hanoi
                        is its Old Quarter, an open-air museum of historic Asian and French colonial
                        architecture that has largely remained intact despite the bombings of
                        Vietnam War. Here among scenic tree-lined boulevards, tourists can browse
                        markets, sip coffee at quaint cafes and visit prominent sites like the Grand
                        Opera House, the Presidential Palace and Saint Joseph Cathedral.

                    <blockquote>
                        Ho Chi Minh City is the largest city of the reunified country, offering plenty of reasons to visit, from its blend of
                        historic and modern attractions to vibrant shopping, dining and nightlife. Actually, I have been to Ho Chi Minh city 	several times,
                        one of the things that I do not like about this place is that it's too hot, the temperature is always ranging from 27 to 30 degrees. However,
                        , other things like food, or Notre Dame Cathedral are worth to travel to this city.

                    <blockquote>
                        Colorful floating markets, fruit orchards, rice paddies, sugar cane groves, bird sanctuaries and quaint
                        villages are all what draw many to the Mekong Delta in southwestern Vietnam. Nicknamed “Vietnam’s Rice Basket,”
                        the Mekong Delta is an agricultural region made fertile by the maze of canals and streams fed by the Mekong River.
                        Stretching from the Gulf of Thailand to Ho Chi Minh City, the Mekong Delta feeds more than a third of the country from
                        its rich plantations, orchards, rice paddies and fish farms.

                    <blockquote>
                        Nha Trang is well known for its beaches and scuba diving and has developed into a popular destination for international
                        tourists, attracting large numbers of backpackers, as well as more affluent travelers on the south-east Asia circuit; it
                        is already very popular with Vietnamese tourists, with Nha Trang Bay widely considered as among the world's most beautiful
                        bays.Tourists are welcome to participate in the Sea Festival, held biennially. Nha Trang was the site of

                    <blockquote>
                        Surrounded by pictorial mountains, rice terraces and a diversity of hill
                        tribes in the remote northwest of Vietnam, Sapa is a quiet town frequently
                        used as a base for trekking in the Hoang Lien Son Mountains and touring rice
                        paddies and traditional villages. From the town, there are many organized tours
                        that aide tourists in mountain hikes and exploring the nearby rice paddies and
                        remote villages. These tours present views of beautiful waterfalls and the
                        opportunities to experience the food, customs and way of life among the local tribes.

                    <blockquote>
                        With its aqua-green water and cluster of limestone rocky outcrops rising
                        from the water like sea dragons, Ha Long Bay resembles a scene from a fantasy
                        story. Located about 130 km (80 miles) east of Hanoi in northern Vietnam, this
                        otherworldly bay features more than 2,000 jungle-covered islands pitted with
                        intriguing caves, grottoes, sinkholes and lakes. Many of the islands have been
                        sculpted over the centuries by natural processes into fantastic formations.

                            Currently, Vietnam is one of the most successful teams in Southeast Asia along with Thailand,
                            Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. It won the ASEAN Football Championship in 2008. While
                            Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam, two national teams existed and both were controlled
                            by similar Vietnam Football Associations. After the two countries unified in 1976 the Vietnam
                            Football Associations was renamed to Vietnam Football Federation.

                            Vovinam (short for Võ Việt Nam; Vietnamese: Việt Võ Đạo, Martial Arts of Vietnam) is a Vietnamese martial art.
                            Vovinam is practiced with and without weapons. It is based on the principle of between hard and soft. It includes
                            training of the body as well as the mind. It uses force and reaction of the opponent. Vovinam also includes
                            hand, elbow, kicks, escape- and levering techniques. Both attack and defense techniques are trained,
                            as well as forms, combat and traditional wrestling. The wide range of techniques include punching,
                            kicking, forms, wrestling, sword, staff, axe, folding fan and others.Self-defense techniques cover
                            defense against weaponless attacks like choking from behind and defense against attacks with knife
                            or sword. Advanced students learn to combine the techniques and learn to defend themselves against
                            armed opponents. Instructors train traditional weapons like the long stick, short stick, knife, sword
                            and sabre. Thereby the weapons serve as training devices for reaching optimal control of body and mind.

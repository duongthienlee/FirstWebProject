                        I have spent a lot of time on finding the information about learning IT, coding etc... And
                        there was an article shown that "how to be come a coder, developer,
                        programmer, software engineer". Confusing right? Some of you may know the difference already, so just ignore it
                        and smile because your are a hard-working student or just because you read too much :). I am, perhaps the one
                        who read too much :).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now I will epitomize the difference between them, and it may help you to decide which path of study
                        that you would like to choose.

                    <h3>Programmers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Programmers write awesome code. Making it clean, well-factored and error free are very important concerns,
                        but not at the expense of getting the job done. It is all about knowing the meaning of "good code" within
                        their domain. They need to have some math skills, but this is not a paramount concern. They need to know
                        of good (best) solutions to problems, but they don't need to prove it is the best solution. A good breadth
                        of algorithmic knowledge is imperative. They have a depth of skill in a wide area of expertise and have
                        reasonably good knowledge of related areas as well. Communication and people skills are desirable traits,
                        but not emphasized. Software process and team dynamics skills are desirable traits, but not emphasized.
                        They work on personal software projects they find of interest in their off time.

                    <h3>Developers</h3>
                    <p>
                        They write code. Making it well-factored and clean is important, but other factors often take priority.
                        Math skills are very much optional, but it does help to be aware of common problems and solutions
                        related to the domain they are in. Communication and people skills are paramount. Process and team
                        dynamics are bread and butter skills. They are consummate generalists without any truly deep specializations.
                        They are expert at finding ways around problems and plugging components together to fulfill a set of requirements.
                        In their personal time they are either trying to build the next Facebook, or engage in activities that
                        have nothing to do with programming, developing, or computer science.

                    <h3>Coders</h3>
                    <p>
                        Anyone who writes code is often referred to as a coder by the people outside the tech industry. However,
                        this all-surrounding term can be considered judgemental for those who live and breathe programming everyday.
                        Coders are commonly considered the least trained or experienced level of programmers. These individuals do
                        not have the same algorithmic knowledge as a programmer or developer, as they are often a beginner in the
                        field, skilled in just one coding language. Coders are usually given the job of writing forthright pieces
                        of code that can easily be delegated by the developers. As some are put-off by the title, it is sometimes
                        used interchangeably with “Junior Programmer” or “Junior Developer.”

                    <h3>Engineers</h3>
                    <p>
                        The title of engineer or software engineer is normally reserved for the highest level, or most expert coders
                        around. Engineers are well versed in three programming languages or more and use their skills to design
                        and implement the overall architecture of the application. They modularize the final product to develop a
                        clean interface, and then work with the programmers and developers to implement the more comprehensive
                        features of the design.

            <h3>ANCIENT FINLAND</h3>
            <p>
                The first humans arrived in Finland about 7,000 BC after the end of the last ice age.
                The earliest Finns were stone-age hunters and gatherers. Over thousands of years successive waves of people entered Finland.
                After 2,500 BC people in Finland lived by farming. About 1,500 BC they learned to make tools and weapons from bronze.
                About 500 BC people in Finland learned to use iron. However the Finns had little or no contact with the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome.

            <h3>Finland in the middle ages</h3>
            <p>
                The recorded history of Finland began in the 12th century. By 1120 Christian missionaries were operating there. They were prepared to use force
                to convert Finland! The Swedish king Eric led a crusade in 1157. An Englishman, Bishop Henry of Uppsala, assisted him. Henry stayed after the Swedish
                soldiers left and he was martyred. Later he became the patron saint of Finland. However in 1172 the Pope said that the Finns would convert then renounce
                their faith as soon as their enemies had left. He advised the Swedes to subject the Finns by permanently manning fortresses in Finland.
            </p>
            <h3>Finland 1500-1800</h3>
            <p>
                The reformation in Finland was led by Mikael Agricola who became bishop of Turku in 1554. When he died in 1557 Finland was firmly Lutheran.
                Then in 1581 Finland was made a Grand Duchy. Meanwhile Helsinki was founded in 1550.
                War broke out again between Sweden-Finland and Russia in 1741. The Swedes were defeated at Villmanstrand. The Russian army occupied the whole of
                Finland but the treaty of Albo, which ended the war in 1743 left the status quo unchanged except that Russia took a small part of Finland.
                War broke out again in 1788. This time a man named Magnus Sprengporten led a separatist movement. However he attracted few followers and the war ended in 1790.

            <h3>FINLAND IN THE 19th CENTURY</h3>
            <p>
                In the late 19th century Finnish nationalism began to grow. As early as 1835 Elias Lonnrot published a collection of Finnish folk poems called Kalevala.
                After 1850 interest in the Finnish language and culture grew stronger. In 1858 the first Finnish speaking grammar school opened.
                By 1889 half of the grammar schools in Finland spoke only Finnish.However at the end of the 19th century Tsar Nicholas II tried to clamp down on Finnish nationalism.
                In 1899 he issued a manifesto, which said he had the power to make laws for Finland, without the consent of the Finnish Diet if those laws affected Russian interests.

            <h3>FINLAND IN EARLY THE 20th CENTURY</h3>
            <p>
                In June 1941 Finland joined with Germany in attacking Russia. The Finns called it the Continuation War. The Finns quickly recaptured their territory.
                However in December 1941 Britain declared war on Finland and after the German defeat at Stalingrad in 1943 the Finns realized they must leave the war.Negotiations
                began in March 1944 but Finland rejected the Russian demands. However defeat was inevitable and Finland made a cease fire with Russia on 5 September 1944.
                After the war Finland was forced to surrender large amounts of territory to Russia. The Finns also had to pay reparations. The Continuation War cost 85,000 Finnish lives.
                However a final peace treaty was made with Russia in 1947.

            <h3>MODERN FINLAND</h3>
            <p>
                Before the Second World War the main occupation in Finland was agriculture. Since 1945 metalworking, engineering and electronics industries have grown but Finland is still
                less industrialized than the other Scandinavian countries. The main resource of Finland is timber.In 1995 Finland joined the EU. In 1999 Finland joined the Euro. Finland
                suffered badly in the recession of 2009 but eventually recovered.Meanwhile in 2000 Tarja Halonen was elected the first woman President of Finland. In the same year Helsinki
                celebrated its 450th anniversary. Today the population of Finland is 5.4 million.

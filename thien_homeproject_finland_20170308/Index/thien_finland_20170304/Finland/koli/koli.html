            <h3> Generally</h3>
            <blockquote>
                The magnificent natural world in Koli and various businesses that operate in the area offer plentiful
                opportunities for activities and experiences. The panoramic view from Ukko-Koli has everything
                that is central to the Finnish landscape: forests, lakes, and islands. Artists have long been
                inspired by Koli, and you will understand why: the most photographed view in Finland has an
                irresistible appeal!Koli is a gateway to North Karelia. Its central location makes Koli an ideal
                starting point for enjoying the surrounding areas and having a fun-packed holiday. Services
                and activities are about an hour’s drive away, and include the village of Vuonislahti,
                surging rapids, fishing, and the tranquil border area in Ruunaa. The monastery in Heinävesi
                is also an excellent sightseeing destination, as is the Finnish Stone Centre. More generally,
                the Karelian lifestyle and Orthodox culture of the region have captured the interest of many
                visitors. A golf course is within easy reach, too.
